Suppose you are playing a game in turn with the computer. Total n number of
sticks are to be picked up in this game. Whoever picks the last one loses the game. Neither the computer nor you can pick up more than 3 sticks at a time. Nobody can skip a turn, i.e.
at least one stick is to be picked up in a turn. Write a program to ensure that the computer
wins optimally (whenever there is a chance) irrespective of the turn.
